Did you fall asleep while watching Netflix again? Or leave your TV playing all night long? This simple PowerShell tool keeps an eye on your Android TV and puts it to sleep automatically after a set time of no activity—but only when the video or show has really stopped.
Unlike basic screen timeout options, this script:

✅ Checks if media is still playing (like Netflix, YouTube, Plex, and more)  
✅ Only turns off the TV when the content finishes  
✅ Avoids shutting down while you're still watching  
✅ Works with any Android TV that you can connect to using ADB
